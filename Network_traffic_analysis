#This programme is made to clean up data from a CSV file and sort it according to predetermined standards, such network traffic patterns. I've successfully used this code on a test dataset, and I think it can be modified for usage in the project's data collection and preparation phase.
#In addition, I looked over the example case study from Ulm University's Student Union for Electrical Engineering that you linked to (https://github.com/vs-uulm/2017-SUEE-data-set). I'm sure that my knowledge of coding and analytical capabilities will be helpful when handling and examining comparable datasets. I have used the network traffic sample, with the help of wireshark I have exported the traffic into a spreadsheet in .csv format.
